// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding conceptual questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------1) What will this log?

var cohort = "Charlie 2021"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: I belive that it will display the number of charters in var cohort =10
// b) Verify and explain: I was right, but I don't know how to count =11


// --------------------2) What will this log?

var greeting = "Hello World!"
//console.log(greeting[3])

// a) Your answer: I belive that it will call upon the index charter in position 3 in var greetings = l
// b) Verify and explain: Correct, it did call on "l"


// --------------------3) What will this log?

var languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
var index = 1
//console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: Since this is an array, I belive that it will call the string in position 1 = JavaScript
// b) Verify and explain: It logged in Ruby, because it is a Zero indexed and Java would be 0


// --------------------4) What will this log?

var weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
//console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: I belive that it will call upon weekendDays array and capatlize all the charters
// b) Verify and explain: When I run it, it gives me an error "TypeError: weekendDays.toUpperCase is not a function",  
// I feel that it should be upercasing the string of weekendDays 


// --------------------5) What will this log?

var dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
// console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer:
// b) Verify and explain:
